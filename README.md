## Project Proposal 

### Description of Problem/Opportunity
The process of selecting a university is an important decision in a student's life, with long-lasting implications on their personal and professional development. Current matching systems online primarily focus on objective criteria like GPA, test scores, and intended major. However, these systems often overlook subjective yet crucial aspects of a university experience, such as campus culture, social environment, and personal growth opportunities. As a result, students might end up in institutions that do not align with their personality, preferences, and values, potentially leading to dissatisfaction and underperformance. Even here at Vanderbilt, students have discussed about regretting their decision commiting to Vanderbilt or are generally unsatisfied with their experience at Vanderbilt. 

### Proposed Solution/Approach
To address this issue, I propose creating a comprehensive university matching application that goes beyond conventional parameters, incorporating subjective elements to provide a more holistic and personalized college match. The application will collect data on various universities, evaluating academic metrics, student culture, campus personality, and social settings. Simultaneously, it will gather student preferences through a detailed questionnaire, considering their academic, social, and lifestyle choices. With this solution, a student can confidently select a college that not only satifies the student's academic qualficiations, but also their other interests. 

Data collection will include the following: 
1. Official University Websites and Publications - Most universities provide detailed information on their official websites, including details about academics, student life, culture, admission requirements, and financial aid.

2. Surveys and Questionnaires - Create surveys to current university students or alumni to gather firsthand accounts of their experiences.

3. Social Media and Online Forums - Reddit (e.g., r/college), College Confidential, university-specific Facebook groups.

4. Direct Communication with Universities - Reaching out directly to universities’ admissions offices or specific departments for information.

The project will use ChatGPT for natural language processing, helping to interpret and generate text-based responses from/to the user. A matching algorithm will then analyze both sets of data to find the best-fit universities for each student. The recommendations will be accompanied by personalized explanations, explaining why each university might suit the student’s preferences. Additionally, a feedback mechanism will be integrated to continuously refine and improve the matching algorithm based on user experiences.

### Project Outline and Timeline
1. Project Prosposal (October 26)
Define project goals, design overview, and metrics.

3. Data Collection and Database Setup (Nov 1)
Gather data on universities and set up a database to store this information. Design the student questionnaire.

4. Development of Matching Algorithm (Nov 14)
Develop the algorithm that will match students with universities based on their preferences and the collected data.

5. Integration of ChatGPT (Nov 21)
Incorporate ChatGPT for processing data. Ensure seamless integration with the matching algorithm.

9. Final Refinements and Project Closure (Dec 1)
Document the project, evaluate success against objectives, prepare for presenation.

## Goals of project 

### Goal 1
Comprehensive Data Collection - Gather detailed data on universities, ensuring coverage of academic, cultural, social, and logistical aspects to facilitate a well-rounded matching process.
### Goal 2
Development of a Matching Algorithm - Create an algorithm capable of analyzing both quantitative and qualitative data to provide personalized university recommendations to students.
### Goal 3
Customer satisfaction - Have a working algorithm that provides satisfaction to the user.

## Project Metrics 

### Metric 1
Evaluate how accurate and relevant the university recommendations are from the users' perspective. This will be measured by using students that are currently in colleges. They will take the survey and determine if the results match with their current unviersitie. 

Measurement:
A: 90-100% of users find the recommendations accurate. 
B: 80-89% of users find the recommendations accurate. 
C: 70-79% of users find the recommendations accurate. 
D: 60-69% of users find the recommendations accurate. 
F: Below 60% of users find the recommendations accurate.

### Metric 2
Measure the completion rate of the user questionnaire to determine if the survey is user-friendly. 

Measurement:
A: 90-100% completion rate, survey is engaging and not overly lengthy.
B: 80-89% completion rate, minor issues with length or engagement.
C: 70-79% completion rate, potential issues with survey
D: 60-69% completion rate, significant issues with survey
F: Below 60% completion rate, serious problems with survey.
